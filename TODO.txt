MIGRATIONS:

- OpenGLES -> Metal
- Convert all XIBs to autolayout
- Openclipart API -> FreeSVG API (which requires a login to use)
- Allow an iOS Files interface to import/export images and fonts

FEATURES:

- Support dark mode (and remove UIUserInterfaceStyle=Light from Info.plist)
- Allow editing external files in-place, instead of copying into the app folder
- Support long press instead of the current manual select-and-act mechanism
- Allow subfolders within the gallery
- Multitasking (split view, slide over, multiple windows)
- Drag-and-drop
- Quick Look previews for *.inkpad files

DROPBOX:

- Progress reporting for activities, or else remove the round circles
- Check the minor TODOs in WDImportController.m

PROBLEMS:

- If a file is added to the app folder through the Files app,
  the gallery view does not refresh
