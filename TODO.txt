MIGRATIONS:

- OpenGLES -> Metal
- Dropbox API v1 -> v2 (or just remove entirely and use Files instead)

FEATURES:

- Support dark mode (and remove UIUserInterfaceStyle=Light from Info.plist)

PROBLEMS:

- Popover layouts to check:
  + CANVAS: (Nav) Settings, Layers, Stroke, Fill, Shadow, Font ; (Other) Swatches, Photos, Text Edit
  + BROWSER: All
- OpenClipArt downloads seem completely broken
- Export preview window has greyed-out (but still working) buttons
- New text is invisible (default colour palette of white-on-white)
- Delete drawing -> still shows as 1 item selected
- Add photo is behaving very strangely (both browser and canvas)
