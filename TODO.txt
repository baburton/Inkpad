MIGRATIONS:

- OpenGLES -> Metal
- Dropbox API v1 -> v2 (or just remove entirely and use Files instead)

FEATURES:

- Support dark mode (and remove UIUserInterfaceStyle=Light from Info.plist)

PROBLEMS:

- Menu popovers (WDMenu) visually broken, gets worse on repeat pressings;
  examples: export menu, long-press tool selection, arrange menu, etc.
- OpenClipArt downloads seem completely broken
- Export preview window has greyed-out (but still working) buttons
- New text is invisible (default colour palette of white-on-white)
- Delete drawing -> still shows as 1 item selected
